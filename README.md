Trying out GitHub for the first time
The development team uses GitHub and they gave me access and made me part of the "team." Now I get all kinds of emails from GitHub and want to understand how it all works. I haven't had any time to play around in here but am making time today because I had to reply to a GitHub comment directed to me.
